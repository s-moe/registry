				<h1>Dotty</h1>
				<h4>A Registry for the Rest of Us.</h4>
			</div>
			<p>
				Welcome to Dotty. Our founder, Sarah Moe, decided early on that she
				didn't want kids of her own. She loves children, but the parent bug
				never scratched her.
			</p>
			<p>
				As she entered adulthood, she found herself spending thousands of
				dollars buying gifts for people because they had a registry. It seemed
				like the only celebrations worthy of a registry were marriages and
				babies. But Sarah and many others had a lot of other things to
				celebrate: divorces, career transitions, going back to school, buying a
				home, or paying off student loans.
			</p>
			<p>
				That's why Dotty was formed. "Dotty" is an adjective to describe someone
				who is eccentric or a dancing to the beat of their own drum (or maybe
				creating a new instrument). If you dance to the beat of your own drum
				and you have something to celebrate, we are here to help make creating a
				registry easy.
