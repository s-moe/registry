Summary: Dotty is a gift registry web application that allows users to create a person gift registration for their non-traditional celebrations. It is intended to bring awareness to non-traditional celebrations (i.e. coming out, going back to school, getting a divorce) and allow friends and family members of the registrant to support and encourage the registrant in their non-traditional celebration. 

Built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, React.js, Express, Node.js). 

There is user authentication, a contact form that automatically sends an email, and the ability to create, read, update, and delete a listing for a registered item.
